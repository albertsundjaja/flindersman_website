Puma BMW Motorsport Drift Cat 7 sneakers, like what the name suggests, resemble car racing shoes. Looks pretty sleek.

# How does the Drift Cat 7 look?

The moment I got it out of the box, I loved it!

Definitely looks pretty cool, and feels high quality for the price.

Sleek and rather minimalistic with an accent of BMW logo at the back.

The box itself has an official BMW certified logo on it saying Licensed by BMW AG.

# How does the Drift Cat 7 fit?

I ordered a US7 size. I usually wear US7 shoes for sneakers. However, my true size is US 6.5.

I like my sneakers to have a little more room in the toe area. My longest foot is 24.1cm (9.5") long,
and the widest part of my widest foot (usually this is the ball of your foot) is 9.5cm (3.7")

The length of the shoes is approximately 27cm (10.6")

![width](/images/puma-bmw-drift-cat-7/width.jpg)

The width is approximately 9.5cm.

I was a bit surprised at the width though, that is exactly what my widest foot is.

I tried the sneakers with sneaker socks, and sure enough it is a very snug fit. The length fits perfectly, but I'm feeling a bit of compression in the ball area.
If I remove the socks, then it fits perfectly to my liking.

It does stretch a bit though, so these shoes really need some breaking in before they get comfortable.

My advice is if your feet are on the wider side, then definitely order half or one size up.

Here is a comparison with Adidas Ultraboost (Ultraboost is also US7 size)

# Conclusion

I bought this on discount at 85AUD (~60USD). For the price, I think this is definitely a good quality sneaker.
They will look good with a track jacket / hoodie and slim fit track pants / jeans.

They are very snug, so make sure to order your true size or go up a size if you have wide feet.

Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy the review.
