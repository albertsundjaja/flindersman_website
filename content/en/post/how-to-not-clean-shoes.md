Let's face it, nowadays we google things on all tasks including how to clean your shoes. However, not all of the advices online are correct and some are even in the realm of madness.

I list some of the ideas that sounds plausible, but in fact, should be avoided when you want to clean your leather shoes.

## DONT use alcohol to clean leather

Alcohol will dries your leather. It might also leave its own stain, and in the worst case scenario it can strip the original dye out of the leather causing permanent discoloration.

## DONT use petrol / benzene / kerosene

The first question we should ask is, are you mad or something? What are you trying to do? Burning your house down?

These chemicals are harmful and corrosive. Please don't even think about using them to clean anything unless you really know what you are doing.

## DONT use concentrated vinegar or other acids

Vinegar nowadays are hailed as the DIY go to cleaning solution. Yes they work might work IF they are dilluted. Never use undilluted vinegar or other acids. Or even better, avoid them altogether. It might dries the leather, or in the worst case scenario causes permanent damage.

Never use undiluted and always test on a small hidden areas first!
Even better, avoid using it to clean leather.

## DONT use concentrated baking soda or other bases

Similar with acids, never use undilluted baking soda or other bases (this includes dishwashing liquid) to treat leather e.g. sprinkling baking soda on top of the leather directly. Bases can also dries the leather and in worst case scenario causes permanent damage.

Never use undiluted and always test on a small hidden areas first!

By the way, if you ever feel the need to strip color from leather, you can mix baking soda and dishwashing liquid together, they work like a charm!
