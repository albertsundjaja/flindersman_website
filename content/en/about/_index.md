I always search online for fashion hacks and guides.

Half of them are fantastic, but the other half gives you REALLY REALLY stupid ideas that can ruin your most beloved stuffs. I have tried cleaning leather using baking soda following an online advice, it was the worst idea ever, it completely ruined my leather shoes. 

So here I am writing my own compilation of fashion hacks and guides which hopefully save someone from ruining their day.
