      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, nowadays we google things on all tasks including how to clean your shoes. However, not all of the advices online are correct and some are even in the realm of madness.
I list some of the ideas that sounds plausible, but in fact, should be avoided when you want to clean your leather shoes.
DONT use alcohol to clean leather Alcohol will dries your leather. It might also leave its own stain, and in the worst case scenario it can strip the original dye out of the leather causing permanent discoloration.</description>
